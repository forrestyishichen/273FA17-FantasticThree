grpc replication in python

two rocksdb go through grpc server

pinterest page

Figure 2

request come to grpc server then talk to rocksdb 1

then replication to rocksdb2 and grpc client


pull or push the error will be different


****

GetLatestSequenceNumber()

GetUpdatesSince()

****

grpc read and write to rocksdb

from master to 1 slave


1) communication model in grpc syn/asyn/stream

2) use sequence # to detect the changes


**********

In this assignment 2, you will be implementing a RocksDB replication in Python using the design from this C++ replicator.  

https://medium.com/@Pinterest_Engineering/open-sourcing-rocksplicator-a-real-time-rocksdb-data-replicator-558cd3847a9d

You can use Lab 1 as a based line. Differences form the replicator are:

You will be using GRPC Python server instead of Thrift server.
You will be exploring more into GRPC sync, async, and streaming.
You can ignore all cluster management features from the replicator.

2. 25% 

3. grpc sterming connection
